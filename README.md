### Description:
Study Buddy is a web application who's purpose is to help users study for any topic they desire, in an effective and fun way. There are a few main components involved in this application that allow it to function in this way:
- **User Registration**: Users can register for a free account using a simple sign-up process using their existing Google or GitHub accounts. Once registered, they can log in and start creating study materials. The app uses the Devise gem for authentication, a very well established gem for this purpose. I chose to only use the Google and GitHub signup options because they are popular and widely used, and I wanted to keep the signup process as simple as possible. This prevents the need to keep users' passwords in the database at all, as well as the need to for any password reset issues. Finally, it prevents the need for the site to send emails, which can be very challenging when proving emails are legitimate and not spam, which can cause lots of issues.
- **Topics**: Users can create, edit, and delete Topics of their choice. Topics are essentially categories that users can create to organize their study material. A Topic would normally represent one defined subject that the user wants to study.
- **Flashcards**: Each Topic can have many Flashcards. Flashcards are essentially question and answer pairs that the user creates. Each Flashcard has a question, an answer, and an optional hint. Flashcards are the main study material that the user will use to study the Topic. The user can create, edit, and delete Flashcards as they see fit.
- **Quiz Mode**: Users can enter Quiz Mode for a Topic. In Quiz Mode, the user will be presented with all Flashcards from that Topic one at a time, with the question displayed prominently on the screen. If the user is unsure of the answer, they can click a button to reveal the hint they added for that question. They can also click a separate button to reveal the answer. The user can then click a button to move on to the next Flashcard. The user can continue to do this until they have gone through all the Flashcards in the Topic.
### Files involved:
- **Core config files**
  - **routes.rb** - Contains all the routes for the application, alloowing for proper routing of requests to the correct controller actions.
  - **database.yml** - Contains the configuration for the database connections to the PostgreSQL database.
  - **Gemfile** - Contains all the gems that the application uses, and their respective versions.
  - **db/migrate folder** - Contains all the migration files that are used to create the database schema.
- **Models**
  - **Topic.rb** - Contains the Topic model, which has a title, description, and many Flashcards. It requires the presence of a title, which allows for validation when creating a new Topic or editing an existing one.
  - **Flashcard.rb** - Contains the Flashcard model, which has a question, an answer, an optional hint, and belongs to a Topic. It requires the presence of a question and an answer, which allows for validation when creating a new Flashcard or editing an existing one.
- **Views**
  - **topics folder** - Contains all the views for the Topic model. It has views for creating, editing, deleting, listing, showing, and entering Quiz Mode for Topics. It has partial views for displaying an existing Topic, and for displaying a form to create or edit a Topic. Partial views allow for reusability of code across multiple views.
  - **flashcards folder** - Contains all the views for the Flashcard model. It has views for creating, editing, deleting, listing, and showing Flashcards. Like the topics folder, it has partial views for displaying an existing Flashcard, and for displaying a form to create or edit a Flashcard.
  - **application.html.erb** - Contains the main layout for the entire application. It has the header and footer of the application, and yields the content of each view that is rendered. It also links to the main css and javascript files for the application. All other views inherit from this layout.
- **Controllers**
  - **TopicsController.rb** - Contains all the controller actions for the Topic model. It has actions for creating, editing, deleting, listing and showing Topics. It also has an action for entering Quiz Mode for a Topic.
  - **FlashcardsController.rb** - Contains all the controller actions for the Flashcard model. It has actions for creating, editing, deleting, listing and showing Flashcards.
- **Tests**
  - All tests for the app are located in the `spec` folder. The tests are written using RSpec, a widely used framework for testing in Ruby. 
- **Other folders and files**
  - The other folders and files in the application are largely auto-generated by Rails, and contain configuration files, helper files, and other files that are necessary for the application to function properly.

### Use of AI Assistance
- **ChatGPT**: I used OpenAI's ChatGPT to help me understand the usage of Ruby on Rails' details. I used it to amplify my own ideas and plans for this study app. It was helpful in learning the nuances of using Ruby on Rails with Postgresql, creating database migrations, and building the erb views. For example, learning how to use its built-in form helpers to create forms, and things like `link_to` and `button_to` to create links and buttons. It was also helpful for some css styling with Bootstrap when I couldn't quite figure something out.

### Design and Implementation choices:
- **Ruby on Rails**: The application is built using Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework written in Ruby. Rails provides a lot of built-in functionality that makes it easy to create web applications quickly and efficiently. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, which helps in organizing the code and separating concerns. I chose it because I have coded in Ruby before and I enjoy the language and wanted to get more experience with it. I wanted to challenge myself to learn more about Ruby on Rails as it compares to using Python with Flask, which was fresh in my mind from the course.
- **PostgreSQL**: The application uses a PostgreSQL database to store all the data. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is widely used in web development. I chose it because it is very often used in conjunction with Ruby on Rails in production applications, and I wanted to have an authentic experience using the tools that would be used in a real-world application.
- **Bootstrap**: The application uses Bootstrap, a popular and powerful CSS framework, for styling. Bootstrap provides a robust set of pre-built components and a responsive grid system, making it easy to create clean, nice-looking layouts. I chose it because it allows for quick development while also ensuring the application looks polished on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Deciding on using AI**: I thought of including AI in the app, but I decided against it because I didn't feel like the benefits outweighed the costs for an initial version. I feel like an initial version of an app should be focused on core functionality, and can easily be overdone to try and make it perfect, which leads to spending way more time on things that don't actually add much value. One addition that I would like to add eventually is the ability to integrate something like OpenAI's ChatGPT API to allow users to create Topics and Flashcards by talking to a chatbot. This would give the user the ability to quickly create study material without having to manually research and type everything out.
  - For example, if they wanted to learn about the solar system, they could ask the chatbot to create a Topic called "Solar System" and to generate 25 Flashcards, each containing a question, hint, and answer, about the solar system. This would be a powerful feature that would save the user a lot of time and effort in creating study material.

### Other areas of potential improvement:
- **Search functionality**: Adding search functionality would allow users to search for Topics and Flashcards based on keywords. This would make it easier for users to find the study material they are looking for, especially as the number of Topics and Flashcards grows. This would be a good feature to add to improve the usability of the application.
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Currently, the application is not optimized for mobile devices. Adding mobile responsiveness would make the application more accessible to users who are using it on their phones or tablets. This would be a good feature to add to improve the user experience of the application.
- **Data visualization**: Adding data visualization features would allow users to see their progress and performance over time. For example, users could see how many Flashcards they have answered correctly and incorrectly, and how their performance has changed over time. This would be a good feature to add to help users track their progress and stay motivated to study.
- **Accessibility features**: Adding accessibility features would make the application more usable for users with disabilities. For example, adding keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support, and high contrast modes would make the application more accessible to a wider range of users. This would be a good feature to add to make the application more inclusive and user-friendly.
